When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r air}
summary(airmiles)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=diamonds,aes(x=table,y=price))+geom_point(aes(color=clarity))
  head(diamonds)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
